# Stencil Starter React

A minimal reproduction monorepo for testing Stencil components with React output targets.

## Structure

```
packages/
├── stencil-lib        # Stencil web components
├── stencil-lib-react  # React wrapper bindings
└── react-app          # Demo React application
```

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22.0.0
- pnpm 9.15.0

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development (builds and watches all packages)
pnpm start

# Production build
pnpm build
```

## Development

The `pnpm start` command will:

1. Build the Stencil component library
2. Build the React wrapper library
3. Start all packages in watch mode with hot reload

The React app will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Packages

### @example/stencil-lib

The core Stencil component library. Components are written in TSX and compiled to web components.

### @example/stencil-lib-react

Auto-generated React bindings for the Stencil components. The `components.ts` file is generated by `@stencil/react-output-target` during the Stencil build.

### react-app

A demo React 19 application that consumes the Stencil components via the React wrapper.
